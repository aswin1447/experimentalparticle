Summary: DIANA/HEP project funded


We are pleased to announce that the [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov) has funded
the [DIANA/HEP](http://diana-hep.org) project through the [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503489&org=ACI&from=home) program. Kyle Cranmer is Co-PI for the 4-year, 4-institute award. [Jinyang Li](http://www.news.cs.nyu.edu/~jinyang/) from the NYU Computer Science Department joins the project as Senior Personell. 

The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics)
is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments which acquire,
reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability,
and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly
used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being
acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities.

The project has a synergistic relationship with all three institutions involved in the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/).
