Summary:  Our group played a key role in new results from ATLAS that indicate that the new particle has no spin, strongly indicating it is indeed a Higgs boson.  In addition, several measurements of the particle's production and decay properties have been made to test if this is the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
