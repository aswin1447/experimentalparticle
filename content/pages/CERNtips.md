<h3><center>Introduction:</center></h3>

Hi.  I tried to collect here some of things people I know or 
I learned the hard way 
the first few times we came to CERN, and others that were 
picked up less painfully.  
Hopefully it will spare you some 
of the troubles I faced.  If it also saves you money, feel free to 
send me a commission. I would also be happy to hear from you if you wish to 
add to this list.

Lots of useful information about travel to CERN can be found on 
the wiki page

<h3><center>Arriving at Geneva Airport:</center></h3>

Geneva airport straddles France and Switzerland, and you can get out in either 
country 
by just following the signs.  But once you make your choice, this is not a 
reversible process - you cannot go back to one from the other through
the airport.  So keep the following in mind:

<UL>

<li> There is public transportation
from the Swiss side to CERN (bus) or Geneva (bus or train). 
But from the French side you will have to take a cab or car (if you rented one
from the French side). 
<li> Public transportation to CERN is in middle of changes due to the partially 
complete tram service.  In particular, the 9 bus no longer goes to CERN.
You can get up-to-date information on using public transportation toget to CERN at 
<a href="http://ph-dep.web.cern.ch/ph-dep/UsersOffice/Howtofindus/Welcome.html">
http://ph-dep.web.cern.ch/ph-dep/UsersOffice/Howtofindus/Welcome.html </a>
<li> There are no banks on the French side.  If you need 
money and are headed to France, make sure to exchange money from the bank 
window you can access before making the France/Switzerland decision.  Remember
that France uses Euros and Switzerland Swiss Francs.
<li> Depending on whether you are going to France or Switzerland, make sure 
you get from the bank some 1 and 2 Euro or 1 and 2 CHF coins - you'll see 
why when you get to transportation.
<li> The French side is much less busy so if you can get there for departure 
it might be easier.  But note that they have to get someone to carry your 
checked in luggage from the French side to the Swiss side.  Depending on the 
airline (that often means if it isn't Air France), you may have to phone
the Swiss side from the French one on an internal phone, and hope that
someone is there to answer the phone.

<a name="money"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Money</center></h3>

<UL>

<li> France uses Euros and Switzerland Swiss Francs (CHF).
<li> In France, you will often see cash register and other displays both 
in Euros and French Francs (worth about 1/10 a Euro).  Don't pay the wrong 
one!
<li> The 1/2 CHF coin is smaller and worth more than the 10 or 20 cent ones 
(before you ask about this, explain pennies, nickels and dimes to me).
<li> Exchanging money is a non-trivial process.  I have found withdrawing money
from an ATM
to be the simplest method (and often the most economical) to get local currency. 
</UL>

<a name="transportation"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Transportation</center></h3>
  
<h3><center>By Bus</center></h3>
<UL>
<li> To get a ride on a bus, you must buy a ticket at the machine located 
near most bus stops.  The ticket is good for a certain distance (the number of
zones you go through) and a certain time duration.  To get to Geneva or CERN 
from the airport, use Tout Geneve that which costs 3 CHF.  Push the button
next to you choice, see the 3.00 light up, then deposit the 3 CHF (before the
light goes off).
<li> You can buy one hour, all day after 9:00 AM, or all day tickets 
for increasing cost.  You can also buy 2 zones, 3 zones, or more.
The after 9:00 AM  3 zone ticket is a great buy if you are spending a day touring Geneva.
<li> If you are staying at a hotel, you can get a public transporation free pass. 
<li> Bus and train machines require exact change.  They won't take 5
CHF coins, and may or may not take 1/2 CHF coins.
<li> Inspectors occassionally come on the bus to check whether riders have 
a proper ticket, and to fine them if they don't.
<li> The number 9 bus has two routes in the direction toward CERN, only one of 
which goes to CERN.  Make sure to check the bus destination displayed at the 
front of the bus before boarding.  CERN is the last stop, so you will have 
plenty of warning about where to get off.
<li> Buses display on screens the next stop and the ultimate bus destination.
</UL>

<h3><center>By Car</center></h3>
<UL>
<li> In France, Switzerland, and much of Europe, cars on the right have right of way, 
unless they have a stop or
yield sign.
This means that if you are on big road and a tiny one without a stop
sign is coming up on your right, that a car there has right of way, and twill likley
assert it!
Occassionally there are signs on the big road letting you know that there is something
coming up where you do or don't have righ of way.
<li> Rural road speed limits in France and Switzerland are 90 km/hr and 
80 km/hr respectively.
<li> In Switzerland you are supposed to have your car lights on whenever you are driving;
I have seen very few people obeying this rule.
<li> This one seems obvious after you know it:  For signs with a place name and arrows
at traffic circle exits, the arrow is pointing to the exit, not to a direction you
should drive.
<li> Cars in a traffic circle have right of way, so watch for their signalling:
<li> Signal left when entering a traffic circle, and right when you are at the
exit you are going to leave it by.
<li> The best advice I got about driving is that if you are in a traffic 
circle and aren't sure which is the right exit to get out, it is 
perfectly permissible 
to go around and around in circles until you have figured it out.  This is also a great 
way to pause if you are getting very frustrated.
<li> The circle is also a great way to make a U-turn.
<li> At Swiss/French border crossings, the lane on the right marked with a green symbol
is for locals who display this sign on their car and can pass through without fear of
being stopped.  You stay on the left.
</UL>

<a name="electronics"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Electronics</center></h3>

<UL>
<li> The European outlet has the ground pin in the wall socket rather
than on the cord you plug in.  As you might stay in a modern apartment that 
only has the grounded sockets, make sure that any plug or converter you buy
has a hole for the ground pin.  Otherwise, you will not be able to plug
in your device.<p>

<li> Switzerland uses a different electrical outlet than much of the rest
of Europe.  The two pins are narrower and spaced slightly further apart.  
The receptacles are built so that the full plug has to fit, not just the
pins.  The standard long oval shaped converters often will not fit. If you 
are plugging a grounded American plug into a converter without ground, the
ground pin will stick out and perhaps spark to the socket base (even if you are lucky
and the pin part does fit).  The correct solution is to find the full converter
from 3 pin US to correctly shaped Switzerland.  The alternative is 3-pin US
to  Europe converter and then a Europe to Swiss
converter.  Since there is no ground pin on the European plug, there is nothing
to stick out and spark.  But you still must make sure that the Europe
to Switzerland converter has the correct shape or it won't fit.

The Swiss plug and socket, compared with the U.S. plug: <p>

</UL>


<a name="language"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Language</center></h3>

<UL>
<li> Most scientists at CERN speak English.  Many of the rest of the people 
there don't. If you don't know French, an introductory "parlez vous anglais?"
(polite form of do you speak English) is a much better way to start a conversation
than just speaking English and assuming you are understood.
<li> If you don't know French well, here is a generalization that may be unfair, but it
has been my experience: People in Geneva will switch to English rather than let you 
kill French.  People in France will appreciate your effort, and are less likely 
to know English (or at least to admit to knowing English).
</UL>

<a name="CERNstuff"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Some How To's at CERN</center></h3>

<UL>
<li> To get registered at CERN you will need a letter from your institution signed
by your chair stating that you are employed and that you have full 
health insurance coverage.
<li> Phone usage at CERN: If you don't understand it, just ignore the French you hear
when you pick up the receiver, then: <p>
For CERN numbers, just dial the 5 digit extension. <p>
For Geneva, dial 0-022-number <p>
For France, dial 10-04-number <p>
For USA, dial *4 (ignore the French if you don't understand it) - 
your pin code (talk to someone else to find out how to get this) - 
0 (to leave CERN) -  00 (to leave Switzerland) - 1 (to enter USA) - then ten digit
area code plus number.
<li> To phone CERN from USA: 011-41-22- seven digit number.<p>
 To dial CERN from outside, you need 022- seven digit number.
<li> Room numbers at CERN are building number - floor number or letter - room number.
So 32-SB08 is building 32, basement, room B08.
<li>Addressing letters to CERN : <p>
    Name <br>
    CERN <br>
    Building-Room <br>
    CH-1211 Geneva 23 <br>
    Switzerland / Suisse 
<li> The Users Office (where you get your badge in the cafeteria building) has all 
sorts of useful stuff like maps of local towns and bus schedules.
</UL>

<a name="foodshopping"><hr></a>
<h3><center>Food Shopping</center></h3>

<UL>
<li> At supermarkets, you have to weigh by yourself produce sold by weight. 
There is a number
displayed with the price.  Put the item on the scale, press the appropiate number, 
and a sticker
will come up for you to put on the plastic bag in which you put the produce.
<li> Supermarkets and other food stores very likely will not give you bags to take your food
home in; you must bring your own.  Supermarkets will often have strong bags for sale for 
30 cents or so. 
<li> Shopping carts are released from the chain holding them to the next cart by inserting a coin 
(usually 1 CHF
or 1 Euro depending on which country you're in) and pressing the appropriate lever.  You get the 
coin back when you return the cart and press the chain back in.
