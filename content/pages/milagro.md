<h3><center>A short description of MILAGRO:</center></h3>

Various energetic processes in the universe, such as the swallowing of matter by 
black holes, eject fast moving particles.
MILAGRO is designed to detect high energy particles of light (photons),
called "VHE gamma rays",
and measure their arrival direction and energy. 
The arrival direction tells the observer where in the sky the particle 
came from, and the energy tells something about the physical mechanisms 
in the astrophysical source from which the particle was emitted.<p>

MILAGRO (the rectangle on the right in Fig. 1)
consists of a large man-made pond 
filled with 
detectors (Fig. 2). 
When a VHE gamma ray enters the earth's atmosphere, it interacts producing
new particles which in turn interact themselves producing even more particles.
When the particles in this "shower" hit the pond, they emit light which is 
measured by the pond detectors.  The time difference between different 
detectors being hit allows determination of the original particle's direction.
The number of detectors hit and how much light they measure gives an 
indication of the original particle's energy.<p>

<h3><center>Why MILAGRO?</center></h3>

The flux of cosmic ray protons and photons fall steeply with energy.
At energies up to 
about 20 GeV the photon flux is high enough to have been well studied by 
relatively small area balloon and satellite detectors.  
Particles above about 100 TeV hitting the atmosphere 
generate air showers containing enough secondaries that 
penetrate the atmosphere to be studied by extensive air shower 
arrays.  Individual sources in the in between range of 100 GeV to 
100 TeV ( "very high energy"  or VHE) have been studied by the air 
cerenkov technique, but
Milagro was the first instrument capable  
of continuously monitoring the full overhead sky at these energies
(Fig. 3).<p>

Figure 3:<p>

MILAGRO has provided an all sky survey of the northern sky at
VHE energies, studied time dependence of emission in known sources and 
discovered new ones.
Since it is continuously operational, Milagro has been used to study
the properties of gamma-ray bursts, setting limits on VHE emission 
from many bursts and possibly detecting one case 
of VHE photon emission. 
Since charged VHE cosmic rays are deflected by the solar magnetic 
field, measurement of shadowing of cosmic rays by the Sun 
allows study  of this field and the search for anti-particles, which would
be deflected in the opposite direction. Search for VHE photons from the Sun has 
also allowed setting a limit on exotic particles trapped in orbit
around the Sun.
Solar flares emitting particles of energy greater than about 5 GeV 
have been detected by an increase in the MILAGRO PMT rates.  MILAGRO also 
allows searching for evaporating primordial black holes which would be 
identified by their unique photon emission characteristics.<p>

<h3><center>What is MILAGRO?</center></h3>
  
The MILAGRO (Multiple Institution Los Alamos Gamma Ray Observatory) consists
of a man made pond lined on the bottom, covered on top and
filled with water.  Photomultiplier tubes 
(PMTs) - detectors which emit an electrical signal when hit by a photon -
are tied with anchor lines 
to a weighted grid on the bottom of the pond and float up to
fixed positions suspended in middle of the water.  
The anchor line lengths are chosen to form 2 planes of PMTs, one about 1.5
meters below the water surface and another 5 meters further down.
A cable to each PMT 
connecting it to  an electronics trailer just outside the pond is used to 
supply high voltage to the PMT and to relay the PMT signal to an electronic 
read out system.  These signals are converted to digital form, analyzed
by computer, and recorded to tape for later processing.
<p>

Major parts of Milagro include the pond, liner, and cover; 
the PMTs and the  anchor grid;
a cover inflation  
system which is able to raise it, lower it, and keep it stable; a lightening
protection system; the water purification and circulation system;
the data acquisition 
electronics and computer system;  The Environmental Monitoring System 
which keeps track of the experimental hardware and physical conditions; 
the calibration system; the off line reconstruction software; and the 
computer simulation software.

<h3><center>How does MILAGRO work?</center></h3>

A VHE photon or proton entering the earth's atmosphere (the primary 
particle) interacts producing
secondary particles.  The secondaries interact producing more particles that
in turn interact themselves.  The result of this process is a large number of 
electrons and photons (and for proton primaries, some hadrons and muons
and many neutrinos)
known as an air shower (Fig. 4).   When such a shower
is incident on the MILAGRO detector, the charged particles emit cerenkov
light in the water which is detected by the PMTs.  
Photons in the shower pair produce in the water producing additional  charged 
particles which emit cerenkov light. 
The combination of sensitivity to particles over the full 
Milagro area, sensitivity to photons as well as charged particles, and 
location at high altitude account for Milagro's ability to detect air 
showers from VHE particles at energies well below those accessible to
extensive air shower arrays.
<p>

Figure 4:<p>
<a href="images/eas.gif"> 
<IMG SRC="images/eas_tiny.jpg" border = 0 height=300 align=center></a><p>

Since the 
shower front propagates near the speed of light, the time difference between 
different PMTs getting hit can be used to determine the arrival angle of 
the shower which gives the arrival direction of the primary.  The amount of 
Cerenkov light detected by the PMTs can be used to get a measure of the 
primary particle energy.


<a name="history"><hr></a>
<h3><center>A brief history of MILAGRO</center></h3>
  
The MILAGRO detector is located in the Jemez Mountains near Los Alamos, 
New Mexico at an elevation of 8690 feet. The 80m x 60m x 8m pond was 
originally used for the Hot Dry Rock Experiment by Los Alamos and looked 
like this:<p>

Figure 5:<p>
<a href="images/mil_site_crop.gif"> 
<IMG SRC="images/mil_site_crop_tiny.jpg" 
border = 0 height=150 align=center></a><p>

In order to use it as a cerenkov detector, the 
existing pond (Fig. 6)  had to be 
cleaned (Fig. 7), contaminated water
which couldn't be sprayed on national forest had to be 
evaporated (Fig. 8), and a new light tight cover 
was put on the pond (Fig. 9), 
after which it looked like Fig. 10.
The pond cover was also coated with 
reflecting paint (Fig. 11) in the summer of 1996
(so that detectors 
and people wouldn't fry underneath the 
black cover (Fig. 12) which got very hot).
For construction each day, the pond cover is inflated to allow entry of people
and equipment.  The cover is lowered at the end 
of the day, onto the bottom when construction is done in the empty pond, and
onto the water when construction is done with water in the pond.
The cover system is also designed to take up the slack in the cover when the 
pond is full of water during operation of the experiment.
Because of the frequency of storms in the area (many of which come on quite 
suddenly and necessitate the difficult job of raising and lowering the cover
quickly (Fig. 13), an improved 
cover control system (Fig. 14) and a 
lightening protection system (Fig. 15)
were installed.

The support structure for the photmultiplier tubes (PMT) used to detect 
cerenkov light
produced by shower particles was constructed 
underneath the cover in two stages.  The pond
bottom grid was installed in the summer of 1995 for the initial run of the 
experiment (Milagrisimo, Fig. 16) which, with 28 
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) 
spread over 600 square meters, 
took data from April to June of 1996. The full 
support structure (Fig. 17)
including the slope was completed in the summer of 1996.
Milagrito, an intermediate size detector with 228 PMTs on the pond bottom,
collected data from February 1997 to April 1998.
The grid was slightly repaired and  
reinforced (Fig. 18) in the summer of 1998.<p>

An early, uncalibrated, timing distribution (Fig. 19)
from Milagrito shows lines whose height is proportional to the shower arrival 
at each PMT.  The primary direction is approximately perpendicular to the 
plane defined by the ends of these lines.
The pulse height distribution (Fig. 20)
can be used to get a measure of the primary particle energy.<p>

The full MILAGRO
detector with 723 PMTs was installed 
in the summer and fall of 1998
by a dedicated group of hard working (Fig. 21)
scientists. Shown below are how 
PMTs were lowered into the pond (Fig. 22),
how the pond was filled (Fig. 23) 
with water, and how PMTs  
appeared in early 
filling stages (Figs. 24 and 25).
In order to improve timing measurements, 
baffles (Fig. 26)
were placed on all PMTs (Fig. 27)
to cut out late arriving large angle light.
Some PMT repair was done by 
boat and diving (Fig. 28) 
during the summer of 1999.

Preliminary data recording with the full Milagro pond 
detector
began in December of 1999. In the early 
sample event pictured (Fig. 29), the individual PMT 
scatter about the fit shower plane is shown.<p>

Full interpretation of the measurements requires 
knowledge of the position of the air shower core (the
center and most dense region of the particle distribution).  
For example, an energetic shower with a large number of 
particles but centered far from the pond can give a similar signal 
in the pond to a lower energy shower falling closer to 
the pond.  An array of "outrigger detectors" surrounding the
pond allow determination of the core position.  The locations of 
these detectors, completed in 2004, is indicated by filled circles 
shown in Figure 30.

The Milagro experiment was turned off in April 2008. Figure 31
shows the inside of the pond with the water level lowered to allow 
removal of top layer PMTs.  Figure 32 shows some of the group 
involved in dismantling Milagro.  They are not unhappy, because the 
PMTs are to be recyled for the new generation 
High Altitude Water Cerenkov detector,
