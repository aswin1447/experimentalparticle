  <h2>Citizen Science at HiggsHunters.org</h2>

Andy Haas from NYU and Alan Baar from the University of Oxford have released <a href="http://www.higgshunters.org">higgshunters.org</a>, the first particle physics venture on <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org">Zooniverse</a>, and featuring real events from ATLAS.

  <h2>Higher Education and Community Involvement</h2>

<p>NYU’s education and outreach effort focuses on students and teachers at the middle and high school level. Currently, only about a third of U.S. high-school students take physics. Experiments at the LHC have already garnered much attention in the media, and that will surely increase as the LHC turns on and physics results are obtained. This presents an excellent opportunity to bring the excitement of physics to students at a stage where interest can translate into selection of courses and, eventually, careers.
</p>
<p>
The NYU High Energy Group’s close association with the NYU Department of Teaching and Learning 
affords it access to a large number of urban schools. We have lectured at local middle schools and high 
schools, and in Department of Teaching and Learning courses. Our collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory's Office of Educational Programs has led to an ATLAS related component in the BNL QuarkNet 
program, The ATLAS Leadership Institute. 
</p>
<p>
Our future plans are to develop with <a href="http://www.bnl.gov/atlas/education.asp 
">BNL a particle physics educational program</a>, based on the methods
we have developed and tested for the high-school level, but now speciﬁcally geared to the middle-school level. 
A collaboration of physicists, educational program professionals, and master teachers will develop curricular materials and present these to middle school teachers and students. As was done for the high school level
program, high-energy-physics web-based conferencing tools will be used to bring students and teachers in 
contact with scientists at CERN and fellow students and teachers from abroad.

  <h2>US-ATLAS Involvement</h2>

<p>
Our group is actively involved in the  <a href="http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSoftware/AnalysisSupport.html#Analysis_Forums">US-ATLAS Analysis Forums</a>.  We also are very active in providing support for analysis tools in the form of tutorials and documentation.  See Akira Shibata's September 15, 2008 article in ATLAS News: [<a href="http://atlas-service-enews.web.cern.ch/atlas-service-enews/features/features_tutorial.php">article</a>].</p>

<p style="float:right;">
CBS had an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4484053n">excellent 60 minutes special</a> on the LHC, with many interviews and shots of the ATLAS experiment and our collaboration.</p>

  <h2>Videos on YouTube</h2>
<p style="float:right;">
There are a number of good videos on ATLAS and the LHC posted on YouTube (and some not-so-good).  See for instance the  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheATLASExperiment">The ATLAS Experiment channel on YouTube</a>.  Below is just one example, that gives a nice overview on how ATLAS works.
