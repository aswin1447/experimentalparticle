  <h2>The ATLAS Experiment</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas">ATLAS</a> is a multi-purpose detector at the <a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/">Large Hadron Collider</a> at the <a href="http://user.web.cern.ch/user/Welcome.asp">CERN Laboratory </a>in Geneva, Switzerland.
The collaboration involves approximately 3000 physicists from 175 institutions and 38 countries.  
ATLAS collects data from proton - proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV (in 2012) 
occuring 40 million times a second.
</p>
<p> 
The detector was designed to search for several different kinds of new physics that might appear 
at the TeV energy range, such as the newly-discovered boson at a mass of ~126 GeV that is consistent 
with the Standard Model Higgs particle.  The energy range of the LHC is sufficient to allow tests of 
many "Beyond the Standard Model" theories such as supersymmetry, and as of 2012 as already placed 
stringent limits on the parameter space of supersymmetric theories.
Our NYU group was officially admitted to the ATLAS collaboration in 2006 and has been active ever since.

  <p>
<a href="http://hallaweb.jlab.org/experiment/APEX/">APEX</a> is an experiment at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Lab</a> that searches for new vector bosons (A') with weak coupling to electrons and with masses < 1 GeV.

  <h2>MECO</h2>

<IMG width="200" SRC="./images/new_meco_detector_tiny.jpg " /></a>

<p>From 1997 until it was terminated in August of 2005, 
we were collaborators on the <a href="http://meco.ps.uci.edu">MECO</a> (Muon Electron COnversion)
experiment, designed to search for muon number violation 
at the Brookhaven National Laboratory 
(BNL: <a href="http://www.bnl.gov"> http://www.bnl.gov </a>)
Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).
With a sensitivity below 10<SUP>-16</SUP>, four orders of magnitude
lower than that of existing measurements,
MECO would have been 
sensitive to rates predicted for such processes by a large class of 
supersymmetric theories.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1998 the NYU group was a member of the D&Oslash; collaboration
(<a href="http://www-d0.fnal.gov"> http://www-d0.fnal.gov  </a>).
Using the Tevatron accelerator at FNAL (the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory: 
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov"> http://www.fnal.gov </a>), 
the D-Zero experiment studies proton
anti-proton interactions at the highest energy currently available at
terrestial accelerators. Measurements included precise testing of the
"Standard Model" of interactions of quarks and leptons (by comparison of
its predictions with the measured W meson and top quark masses),
comparison with theoretical predictions of strong interaction behavior (
quantum chromo-dynamics ) and search for new particles such as those
predicted by supersymmetry.</p>

<p>The NYU group has also been active in the study of particles not coming 
from Earth-based accelerators but originating instead in astronomical sources.
<!-- <a href="http://umauhe.umd.edu/milagro.html">MILAGRO</a> -->
<a href="milagro.html">MILAGRO </a>
(Multiple Institution Los Alamos
Gamma Ray Observatory)
was a high energy gamma ray astrophysics experiment in the Jemez 
Mountains near Los Alamos, New Mexico ( http://www.lanl.gov ). It was the first
detector designed to allow continuous detection from the full over-head sky 
of photons with energy of about 100 GeV to 100 TeV (VHE gamma rays). Among
the studies which were out with MILAGRO were a VHE gamma ray survey of the 
northern sky, during which we discovered several new TeV sources, monitoring 
of known VHE gamma ray sources, study of gamma ray bursts, and studies of the 
solar magnetic field and solar flares. Our NYU group started working on Milagro 
in 1990. The experiment ceased operation in April of 2008, when the final shift 
was performed by NYU graduate student Grant Christopher.
Some analysis of MILAGRO data is still underway.
