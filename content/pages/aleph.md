Summary: 


In 2009, Kyle Cranmer, graduate student James Beacham, and post-doc Itay Yavin joined forces to analyze 10 year old ALEPH data in order to search for an exotic decay of the Higgs that would have been missed by previous LEP analyses. 
This was before the Higgs discovery in 2012, so there was a lot of excitement when we realized we had $5\sigma$ sensitivity to discover with the data on hand.  


The entire project was a learning lesson that prompted Cranmer and the NYU group to become increasingly
involved in data preservation and open access. The project directly lead to the 
[RECAST](http://recast.perimeterinstitute.ca) project.
