<p>
The Experimental Particle Physics Group at New York University is thriving!  
Our primary focus is the <a href="history.html#atlas">ATLAS</a> experiment 
at the <a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/">Large Hadron Collider</a>.  
We recently hired a new faculty member and a research associate, and now 
have several key roles in ATLAS.  We are also key contributors to the 
<a href="history.html#apex">APEX</a> experiment at Jefferson Lab, 
are active in the LHC upgrade,
were long term members of the  <a href="history.html#milagro">MILAGRO</a> 
experiment until it came to an end and gave way to the next generation
HAWC experiment, and 
were involved in the <a href="history.html#meco">MECO</a> experiment before its termination.  Please have a look at our <a href="group.html">group</a>.

  <h2>Nobel Celebrations</h2>
<a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/10/CERN-congratulates-Englert-and-Higgs-on-Nobel-in-physics"><img style="width:300px;" src="images/higgs-and-englert.jpg"/></a>
<p>
On Tuesday, October 8th, 2013, the Nobel Prize in Physics was <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/">awarded</a> to Fran√ßois Englert and Peter Higgs...
</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron
Collider&quot;.
</blockquote>

<p>
The announcement happened to occur while the annual <a href="http://ruphe.fsac.ac.ma/AtlasWeek2013/index.php">ATLAS Overview Week</a> was being held in Marrakech, Morocco, and NYU Experimental Particle Physics Group members James Beacham and Kirill Prokofiev were in attendance and <a href="images/ATLASWeekMarrakechNobel2013.png">watched the announcement with hundreds of other ATLAS members</a>.  The whole room burst into applause upon hearing the announcement.

Back in New York, the rest of the group <a href="http://youtu.be/cxQKXRi_ezA">held a celebration in Meyer Hall</a>.  The mention of ATLAS in the official citation of the Nobel Prize made this a particularly proud moment for the entire collaboration and for our NYU group, since we played several key roles in the discovery.

  <h2>Observation of a new Higgs-like particle at a mass of ~126 GeV</h2>
<a href="http://www.atlas.ch/news/2012/latest-results-from-higgs-search.html"><img style="width:300px;" src="images/HiggsComb_P0_2012July.png"/></a>
<p>
On July 4, 2012, CERN held a <a href="http://press-archived.web.cern.ch/press-archived/PressReleases/Releases2012/PR17.12E.html">joint ATLAS+CMS seminar</a> where each experiment presented results indicating the observation of a new particle consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson with a measured mass of ~125-127 GeV.  
The excess of Higgs-like events was observed in several possible decay channels, each of which required a separate analysis, and the NYU ATLAS group was (and is) heavily involved in two of these analyses: Higgs-to-four-leptons and Higgs-to-two-photons.  
Additionally, all of the separate analyses needed to be combined for <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X">the final ATLAS result, published in Physics Letters B</a>.  
In the ATLAS Collaboration, this Higgs combination task fell to a small group of experts, one of whom was our own Kyle Cranmer, Editor of the combination paper.
</p>
<p>
This is a major milestone not just in particle physics but in the history of science, and the NYU group is proud to have played a part in the discovery.  
The observation of a new boson is just the first step, however.  Further analyses are underway to examine the properties of this particle to determine whether it is indeed the Standard Model Higgs or something different (and there are intriguing hints that this is the case).
