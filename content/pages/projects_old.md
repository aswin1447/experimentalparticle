  <h2>Higgs Searches</h2>
  <img src="./images/atlas/higgs_potential_small.jpg">
  <p>
    Professor Cranmer has been active in ATLAS Higgs searches for several years, focusing primarily on low-mass Higgs searches through the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) mechanism.  The low-mass range is preferred by precision electro-weak measurements and supersymmetric scenarios.  In particular, Higgs decaying to tau leptons is a promising channel.  Cranmer is the convenor of the US-ATLAS Higgs analysis forum.  Akira Shibata and two prospective graduate students, George Lewis and Jordan Ziegler, are joining the effort.  We also keep close contact with our theorist colleagues in the <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/index.html">CCPP</a> about <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=find+a+weiner+and+chang&FORMAT=WWW&SEQUENCE=">non-standard Higgs models</a>.

  <h2>Triggering</h2>
  <img src="./images/atlas/Trigger_small.png">
  <p>
The NYU group is working on the Missing Transverse Energy (MET) part of the High Level Trigger (HLT). MET, which measures an imbalance of momentum in the plane transverse to the particle collision, is sensitive to production of particles that don't interact in the detector. It is therefore a vital part of the search for new physics, and is a natural trigger component for us to study given our group's interest in the search for supersymmetry. Some of the possible sources of fake MET include mismeasurement of jet energies in QCD jet events, detector cracks, and beam-halo interactions. As these can be many orders of magnitude more frequent than SUSY events, they put severe constraints on the MET trigger.  Kyle Cranmer and Diego Casadei are the co-coordinators of the ATLAS MET trigger "slice";
Allen Mincer and Rashid Djilkibaev are active developers of the triger algorithms; and Peter Nemethy and Long Zhao are active in validation of the trigger algorithms and understanding the trigger performance. </p>

  <h2>Supersymmetry</h2>
  <img src="./images/atlas/SUSY_Chain_small.png">
  <p>
    Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most well-motivated and well-developed scenarios for physics beyond the standard model.  If SUSY is the solution to the hierarchy problem, then it is very likely that we will see SUSY particles at the LHC.  In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-parity">R-parity</a> conserving SUSY models, decays of SUSY particles always end with the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), which is stable and weakly interacting.  Thus, the LSP provides a natural candidate for dark matter.  While the LSP would escape ATLAS undetected, it would leave a signature in Missing Transverse Energy (MET).  This provides a strong link between our groups interest in SUSY and our work on MET triggers.  If we are lucky enough to discovery SUSY at the LHC, the next challenge will be measuring the properties of the particles and unravling the many potential SUSY scenarios.  Rostislav Konoplich and Rashid Djilkibaev are actively developing a novel mass measurement strategy, which promises competative measurements with a fraction of the data.

  <h2>The ATLAS Analysis Model and EventView</h2>
<img src="./images/atlas/EventViewPoster_small.png">
<!--  <img src="./images/atlas/EventView_small.png">-->
  <p>
The LHC experiments will produce an unprecidented amount of data, which poses a significant computing challenge.  The ability to quickly and felxibly analyse those data is critical to the success of the ATLAS collaboration.  NYU plays a major role in the development of the ATLAS Analysis Model.  Kyle Cranmer was the original developer for many of the classes which are used to store the ATLAS data (eg. the AOD and ESD) and is the physics analysis tools group representative on ATLAS's Event Data Model committee and the Architecture-team.</p>

<p>EventView is an analysis framework originally developed by Kyle Cranmer, Akira Shibata, and Amir Farbin (U. Texas-Arlington).  The EventView framework works within ATHENA (the ATLAS software environment) and promotes a model that facilitates the sharing of analysis code throughout the collaboration.  It has been tremendously successful within ATLAS, hundreds of users and a growing developer community.</p>

<p>
In addition to contributions to the data format and physics analysis tools, the NYU group also plays an important role in integrating the various components into a cohesive "analysis model".  In particular, this means integration and testing with <a href="http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/computing/grid/">Grid computing</a> (like <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/Panda">PanDa</a>) and the <a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> environment.

  <h2>Statistical Methods for Particle Physics</h2>
  <img src="./images/atlas/phystat_small.png">
  <p>
    Statistics plays an important role in science, and particularly in high-energy physics.  Taking full advantage of the data, while properly incorporating systematic errors is a difficult task and often involves combining several sources of data in a complicated statistical model.  In addition to important formal developments by our group (see links below), Kyle Cranmer is on the steering committee of the <a href="http://Phystat.org">Phystat.org</a> and an appointed member of the ATLAS statistics committee.  He and Rene Brun have initiated the RooStats project -- a suite of high-level statistical tools in ROOT built on top of <a href="http://roofit.sourceforge.net">RooFit</a>.  It has already been demonstraited that one can digitially publish a full likelihood model, together with the relevant data, in order to statistically combine multiple measurements or perform multi-dimensional parameter scans.

  <h2>LHC Upgrade</h2>
  <img src="./images/atlas/SLHC_small.png">
  <p>
    While the LHC is just starting, we are already thinking about an LHC upgrade: the Super-LHC.  The Super-LHC would use the same tunnel that exists at CERN now, but it would have 10 times the luminosity.  This extremely high luminosity environment poses several detector, triggering, and data acquisition challenges.  Allen Mincer, Chris Musso, and Peter Nemethy are collaborating with Brookhaven National Lab in the development of the support structures for a new inner-detector.
