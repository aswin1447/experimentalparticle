Summary:  We are migrating our group's web pages to Pelican.


We are migrating our group's web pages to Pelican.

Now you can type $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ or some physics like $h \to \tilde{\chi}^0_2  \tilde{\chi}^0_1$ followed by $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to  \gamma \tilde{G}$ !

We can add some pretty code

```python
    def main():
        print 'welcome to Pelican'
```

You can link to blog posts on a topic like [projects](tag/projects.html)

We can also embed IPython notebooks.

{% notebook BasicRooFitExample.ipynb %}
