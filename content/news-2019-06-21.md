  We are delighted that Leonora Vesterbacka has joined our group as a Research Scientist.
  Leonora graduated from ETH Zurich working on the CMS experiment focusing on searches for supersymmetry.
  She will be making the transition back to ATLAS (yes, she worked on ATLAS before CMS), where she will focus on Physics Modelling, Machine Learning, and Analysis Preservation.
