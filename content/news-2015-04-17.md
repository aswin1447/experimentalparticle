Summary:  Our group invites applications for an ATLAS post-doctoral research associate

The [experimental particle physics group at New York University](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/) invites applications for a post-doctoral research position to work on the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

The successful candidate will work primarily with Prof. Kyle Cranmer and will contribute to searches for beyond-the-standard model physics and/or further the groupâ€™s leadership role in measurements of the newly discovered Higgs boson. The research will also involve development of novel and high-impact methodology and tools. Examples of past contributions include the statistical [formalism](http://inspirehep.net/record/860907) and tools in [RooStats](http://inspirehep.net/record/868303) used for the Higgs discovery, the [HistFactory](http://inspirehep.net/record/1236448) modeling tool, targeted [data sharing](http://inspirehep.net/record/1275827) between hep-ex and hep-ph, and the [Recast](https://recast-demo.cern.ch/) framework for analysis reinterpretation. Possible future projects include application of newly developed approaches to [machine learning in HEP](https://old.nips.cc/Conferences/2014/Program/event.php?ID=4292), further development of the Recast framework and related efforts in [analysis preservation](http://analysis-preservation.cern.ch/), improved treatment of systematics in HistFactory, application of Gaussian Processes in HEP, and other formal topics. Expertise in these areas offer an excellent way to distinguish oneself for further career opportunities.

Candidates should have both a solid understanding of LHC physics and strong technical skills around data analysis.

The position can  be based either at NYU or at CERN.  The postdoc can benefit from the lively atmosphere of the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/) as well as the [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment](http://cds.nyu.edu/mooresloan/) at NYU. Further information on the experimental particle physics group at NYU may be found at [here](http://physics.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/)

Applications must be submitted via the [Online Application System](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/experimentalparticle/app_register.html?&ptitle=pdoc). Your complete application must include a CV, publication list, statement of research interests, and a list of three people who will be submitting letters of recommendation. The position is available immediately and applications will be considered until the position is filled, but to ensure full consideration, candidates should apply by May 15, 2015.
