 * October 3, 2013: James Beacham, as part of an invited talk about the APEX Experiment at the <a href="http://menu2013.roma2.infn.it/index.html">MENU 2013 conference</a> in Rome, Italy, makes the first public announcement that the data from the APEX test run are now <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/923960/hepdata">public</a>, a nice step forward for open science.

 * May 17, 2013: George Lewis graduates with his Ph.D. based on his thesis entitled "Measurements and Searches for New Physics Using Top Quarks at the LHC"

 * March 14, 2013: Our group played a key role in new results from ATLAS that indicate that the new particle has no spin, strongly indicating it is indeed a Higgs boson.  In addition, several measurements of the particle's production and decay properties have been made to test if this is the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
